# Polio
Polio is a cutsom poll application built in Django and Bootstrap. 

## General info
Users can see different polls at Polio and they can post their own ones as well. The project was created based on the offical Django tutorial(https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/intro/tutorial01/) and was enhanced with some extra features:
* User Authentication: login required to vote or create a poll. One user can only vote once for a question.
* Registered useres can edit and delete their own polls.
* The app has pagination.
* Built in search engine: Polls can be filtered by making quereis for categories.
