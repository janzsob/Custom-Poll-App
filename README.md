# Polio
Polio is a cutsomn poll application built in Django and Bootstrap. Users can see different polls at Polio and they can post their own ones as well. The project was created based on the offical Django tutorial(https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/intro/tutorial01/) and was enhanced with some extra features:
- User Authentication: login required to vote or create a poll. One user can only vote once for a question.
- Registered useres can edit and delete their own polls.
- The app has pagination.
- Built in search engine: Polls can be filtered by making quereis for categories.
